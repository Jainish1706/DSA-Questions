Problem statement
Given an array/list 'ARR' of integers and a position ‘M’. You have to reverse the array after that position.

Example:

We have an array ARR = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} and M = 3 , considering 0 
based indexing so the subarray {5, 6} will be reversed and our 
output array will be {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 5}.



def reverseArray(arr, m):
    n = len(arr)
    b = [None]*n
    i = 1
    for j in range(m+1):
        b[j] = arr[j]
    for j in range(m+1, n):
        b[j] = arr[n-i]
        i = i+1
    return b
